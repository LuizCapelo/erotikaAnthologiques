title: REDEFINING THE ANTHOLOGY: FORMS AND AFFORDANCES IN DIGITAL CULTURE - compte rendu
---

## Introduction

Two main questions: why the anthologic form has returned in TV and how it has changed since its original configuration

Anthology: a concept and a practice

Digital humanities: interdisciplinary area at the intersection of computacional sciences and the humanities
Digital tools in humanistic research.

In media system, evolution coexiste with disruption

L'anthologie est aussi un format, et ce format est appliqué à différents médias.

> a discussion on the anthology first and foremost as a cultural forma presenting a certain set of affordances, but also as a practice, a model, a process. (p. 21)

In anthology, the content is accentuated by a formal division into discrete narrative modules. There is a hole which is divided in smaller individual pieces. 

## Chapter 1: A morphology of serial narratives

> from its very origin the anthology form presented itself as a collection of separate, standalone stories. Narratives are therefore the *nuclei* of the anthology, which is primarily a form built on the assemblage of multiple forms. (p. 30)

Narrative: terme polysémique
- l'acte textuel ou verbal ; mise en discours
- les sujets du discours et leurs relations
- le moment de la narration (action performative)

Narratology: form , structure on which stories are built. 
Narratives, according to Propp, are divided in form -- field of a morphologic study -- and content -- that depends of the form to be legible.

Structuralism: there is no form or content, just structures. Form and content are of the same nature amenable to the same type of analysis.

> the anthology can be read as a *form* that gives a *structure* to narrative *content* in relation to a cultural, social, economic *context*, among others (p. 34)

Les trois éléments internes au texte: forme, contenu et structure. L'élément extérieur au texte: contexte

> I will discuss anthologies as "types of mental structure, including categorical, matrix, serial, schematic, and story structure" (Mandler 1984), which, in the context of digital platforms, are likely to superpose onto AI-generated structures. (p. 35)

Narratives et anthologies: "modes of knowledge" et formes culturelles

1.2 Of formats, forms, formulas. towards a re-formulation

Des concepts à dévoiler: format, forme et formula

Format:
- des components structuraux qui affectent le contenu
- "the total body of knowledge systematically and consciously assembled to facilitate the future adaptation under license of the program" (Moran and Malbon 2006: 7)
- Dimension legale
- Dimension culturale 
- Dimension economique
- Dimension productive (Jean K. Chalaby)
- Dimension narrative

Forme:
- "an arrangement of elements -- an ordering, patterning, or shaping" (Levine 2015: 3)
- "Totalité" de la forme 
- "Rhythm", la temporalité de la forme
- Hierarchie, l'ordre de la forme
- "Réseau" les formes, et les réseaux, ont des configurations systematisées et ordonnées.

Formula:
- " a process of absorption of cultural practices or norms, and genre, which has a long history in literary studies taking a structuralist perspective in search for narrative patterns and cues" (p. 40)

Ces trois termes sont importants pour comprendre l'importance de la repétition, de la regularité et du retour aux anthologies.
