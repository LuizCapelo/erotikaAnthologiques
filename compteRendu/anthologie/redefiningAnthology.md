---

## Introduction

Two main questions: why the anthologic form has returned in TV and how it has changed since its original configuration

Anthology: a concept and a practice

Digital humanities: interdisciplinary area at the intersection of computacional sciences and the humanities
Digital tools in humanistic research.

In media system, evolution coexiste with disruption

L'anthologie est aussi un format, et ce format est appliqué à différents médias.

> a discussion on the anthology first and foremost as a cultural forma presenting a certain set of affordances, but also as a practice, a model, a process. (p. 21)

In anthology, the content is accentuated by a formal division into discrete narrative modules. There is a hole which is divided in smaller individual pieces. 

## Chapter 1: A morphology of serial narratives

> from its very origin the anthology form presented itself as a collection of separate, standalone stories. Narratives are therefore the *nuclei* of the anthology, which is primarily a form built on the assemblage of multiple forms. (p. 30)

Narrative: terme polysémique
- l'acte textuel ou verbal ; mise en discours
- les sujets du discours et leurs relations
- le moment de la narration (action performative)

Narratology: form , structure on which stories are built. 
Narratives, according to Propp, are divided in form -- field of a morphologic study -- and content -- that depends of the form to be legible.

Structuralism: there is no form or content, just structures. Form and content are of the same nature amenable to the same type of analysis.

> the anthology can be read as a *form* that gives a *structure* to narrative *content* in relation to a cultural, social, economic *context*, among others (p. 34)
