La littérature pornographique au XVIII^eme^ 

> pornography has often been argued to be one of the typical or defining genres of modernity, coming distinct being only toward the later part of this period. (p. 3)

Avant 1800, le mot pornographie n'était pas

> Its etymological derivation from the ancient Greek words *pornē* and *graphē* gives the term an air of antiquity, but apart from a single usage of the compound *pornographoi* (to mean painters of prostitutes) by Athenaeus in the second century CE, the word is unknown before its reinvention by the French author Rétif de la Bretonne for the title of his 1769 treatise on prostitution, *Le Pornographe*. In its now principal sense of any sexually explicit writing or art, *pornographique* was first used in French in 1806, and *pornography* in English in 1842.

Pornographique, obscène, érotique, indecent. Quels sont les criteria pour le distinguer?
1. L'intention de l'auteur (offrende, gâter, exciter, plaire, etc.)
2. Contenu (sexuel, violence, comedie, romance, etc.)
3. Tone (sentimental, grotèsque, humoristique, etc.)
4. Style ou mode de réprésentation (réalistique, explicite, métaphorique)
5. Les réponses des lecteurs (excitement, rire, dégueulasse)

> this terminological disorder is also useful, for it reminds us that there were no neat boundaries separating the types of sexual or erotic writing in the period and that all these texts, like the fictions that later came to be called novels, wer miscellaneus, hybrid creations. (p. 5)

Pornography: the explicit depiction of sexual organs and sexual practices with the aim of arousing sexual feelings. 

> it is ultimately content and techniques or modes of representation that best enable us to define the erotic, obscene, pornographic. \[ ...] The obscene is a violation, whether in terms of subject (sodomy,masturbation, incest, etc.) or stylistic register (such as its flaunting of rude words).
